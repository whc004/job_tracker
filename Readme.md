# Job Tracker

A comprehensive full-stack job application tracking system that combines a Chrome Extension, REST API, and React Dashboard to help you organize and manage your job search efficiently.

## Overview

Job Tracker eliminates the pain of manually tracking job applications across multiple platforms. With one click, save job details from LinkedIn directly to your personal dashboard, complete with auto-extracted company info, salary ranges, technical requirements, and more.

> **Why the User ID system?** We use a lightweight user ID approach instead of complex authentication to keep our MongoDB storage minimal and free-tier friendly. This keeps the service sustainable without database bloat.
