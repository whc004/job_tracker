# Dashboard Update Overview

This document summarises the key modifications introduced in the refreshed dashboard experience.

## JobTracker component
- Expanded the header into a glassmorphism-inspired hero section that surfaces the application count, filter summary, and quick navigation controls.
- Enlarged the search input and status filter pills to improve readability and highlight the active selection.
- Added contextual copy to clarify the purpose of each panel and guide first-time users through the workflow.

## Analytics component
- Added a scope toggle that lets users switch between filtered results and the full dataset while keeping the rest of the UI in sync.
- Refined empty-state handling so that users understand why a chart has no data and how to resolve it.
- Hardened the chart rendering logic to guard against missing dates, unknown statuses, or incomplete job entries.

These changes were applied in the latest iteration to address earlier feedback about typography size, analytics scope, and overall visual hierarchy.
