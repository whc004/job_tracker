# Dashboard Update Overview

This document summarises the key modifications introduced in the refreshed dashboard experience.

## JobTracker component
- Expanded the header into a glassmorphism-inspired hero section that surfaces the application count, filter summary, and quick navigation controls.
- Enlarged the search input and status filter pills to improve readability and highlight the active selection.
- Added contextual copy to clarify the purpose of each panel and guide first-time users through the workflow.

## Analytics component
- Added a scope toggle that lets users switch between filtered results and the full dataset while keeping the rest of the UI in sync.
- Refined empty-state handling so that users understand why a chart has no data and how to resolve it.
- Hardened the chart rendering logic to guard against missing dates, unknown statuses, or incomplete job entries.

These changes were applied in the latest iteration to address earlier feedback about typography size, analytics scope, and overall visual hierarchy.

## Testing the snapshot files locally (without pushing to GitHub)
If you want to experiment with the updated components on your machine before committing anything, you can temporarily copy the snapshot files from `docs/review/` into the live source tree:

1. Make a backup of your current components so you can revert quickly if needed:
   ```bash
   cp client/src/components/JobTracker.js client/src/components/JobTracker.backup.js
   cp client/src/components/Analytics.js client/src/components/Analytics.backup.js
   ```
2. Copy the review snapshots into place:
   ```bash
   cp docs/review/JobTracker.js client/src/components/JobTracker.js
   cp docs/review/Analytics.js client/src/components/Analytics.js
   ```
3. Start your dev server or run the build to test the behaviour locally:
   ```bash
   npm --prefix client install   # only if you haven\'t already
   npm --prefix client run dev   # or npm --prefix client run build
   ```
4. When you are finished testing, restore your original files with git (or the backups if you prefer):
   ```bash
   git checkout -- client/src/components/JobTracker.js client/src/components/Analytics.js
   # or
   mv client/src/components/JobTracker.backup.js client/src/components/JobTracker.js
   mv client/src/components/Analytics.backup.js client/src/components/Analytics.js
   ```

This workflow lets you try the new implementation locally without having to push anything upstream until you are satisfied with the results.
